        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Storytelling App</strong> is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This privacy policy outlines how we use any data that you provide while using our app.</p>
        
        <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Currently, the app is in development mode, and no personal data is collected or shared. The app may request basic information like email and username for testing purposes only.</p>

        <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
        <p>We use the data for internal testing and app improvements. No information is shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. However, since this is a development version of the app, data security might not be as robust as in the production phase.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy as the app evolves. Make sure to check this page for any updates.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
